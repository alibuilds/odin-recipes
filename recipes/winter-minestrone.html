       <li>4 ounces pancetta, ½-inch diced</li>
       <li>1½ cups chopped yellow onions</li>
       <li>2 cups (½-inch) diced carrots (3 carrots)</li>
       <li>2 cups (½-inch) diced celery (3 stalks)</li>
       <li>2½ cups (½-inch) diced peeled butternut squash</li>
       <li>1½ tablespoons minced garlic (4 cloves)</li>
       <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves</li>
       <li>26 ounces canned or boxed chopped tomatoes, such as Pomi</li>
       <li>6 to 8 cups chicken stock, preferably homemade</li>
       <li>1 bay leaf</li>
       <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
       <li>1 (15-ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed</li>
       <li>2 cups cooked small pasta, such as tubetti</li>
       <li>8 to 10 ounces fresh baby spinach leaves</li>
       <li>1/2 cup good dry white wine</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons store-bought pesto</li>
       <li>Freshly grated Parmesan cheese, for serving</li>
   </ul>

   <!-- Steps -->
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
       <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat in a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven. Add the pancetta and cook over medium-low heat for 6 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned.</li>
       <li>Add the onions, carrots, celery, squash, garlic, and thyme and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes, until the vegetables begin to soften.</li>
       <li>Add the tomatoes, 6 cups of the chicken stock, the bay leaf, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1-1/2 teaspoons pepper to the pot. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes, until the vegetables are tender.</li>
       <li>Discard the bay leaf. Add the beans and cooked pasta and heat through. If the soup is too thick, add more chicken stock as needed.</li>
       <li>Just before serving, reheat the soup, add the spinach, and toss with 2 large spoons. Cook just until the leaves are wilted. Stir in the white wine and pesto.</li>
       <li>Depending on the saltiness of the chicken stock, add another teaspoon or two of salt to taste.</li>
       <li>Serve large shallow bowls of soup with a bruschetta on top. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, drizzle with olive oil, and serve hot.</li>
